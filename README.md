# RNAseq_Transcriptional_Fidelity

This code was developed for the analysis of RNA polymerase errors in the transcriptome of Salmonella enterica enterica Typhimurium 14028s from bulk RNAseq data.

Use 20230105_TranscriptionError_Pipeline.Rmd first with your fastq read files and reference genome. Run all chunks in this code until line 326, then run the first code chunk in 20230105_TranscriptionError_Rcode.Rmd to generate the custom feature table. After downloading the feature table, go back to 20230105_TranscriptionError_Pipeline.Rmd to run the remaining code before moving on to the rest of 20230105_TranscriptionError_Rcode.Rmd.
